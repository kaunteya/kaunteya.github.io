For fast navigation on any editor

One of the best things about macOS is it natively supports emacs text editing & navigation shortcuts. That is you can use any shortcut irrespective of what Editor you are using

Here is the list

`Ctrl A` -> Move to beginning of line

`Ctrl E` -> Move to end of line

`Ctrl M` -> Create and move to new line

`Ctrl H` -> Delete backward

`Ctrl D` -> Delete forward

`Ctrl F` -> Move one character forward

`Ctrl B` -> Move one character backward

`Ctrl K` -> Delete line from current cursor position

`Ctrl T` -> Transpose cahracters around cursor

`Ctrl M` -> Transpose cahracters around cursor


## Benefits

#### Productivity boost
In the first glance this shortcuts may seem trivial, but they are very effective.
If you do a lot of typing then using this shortcuts will definitely save a lot of time.

For example instead of always reaching out to [Backspace][1] you can always use `Ctrl H`.

#### Works in Terminal
The added benefit is these shortcuts work perfectly well in Terminal no matter what shell you use
