## FAQ for Linko
----

<br><br>
##### What happens when none of the rules match?
In this case the link would open in Default browser. Default browser can be changed from Preferences.

<br><br>

##### What happens if I put contradicting rules? Eg. Rule 1 says open google.com in Safari and Rule 2 says open google.com in Chrome
In this case any rule that matches first would hold true. Once any rule is matched and the subsequent rules are not checked

<br><br>

##### Will my rules work if I quit the app?
Yes

<br><br>

##### What happens to the rules that have no constraints?
Rules are considered only when there is atleast one constraint and a valid Browser set to it
