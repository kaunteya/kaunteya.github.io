One of the features of macOS is it natively supports emacs style text editing & navigation shortcuts. That is you can use these shortcuts irrespective of the editor you are using.

### Here is the list

`Ctrl A` -> Move to beginning of line

`Ctrl E` -> Move to end of line

`Ctrl N` -> New Line

`Ctrl P` -> Previous Line

`Ctrl M` -> Carriage return

`Ctrl H` -> Delete backward

`Ctrl D` -> Delete forward

`Ctrl F` -> Move one character forward

`Ctrl B` -> Move one character backward

`Ctrl K` -> Delete line from current cursor position

`Ctrl T` -> Transpose cahracters around cursor

`Ctrl M` -> Transpose cahracters around cursor


## Benefits

#### Productivity boost
In the first glance this shortcuts may seem trivial, but they are very effective.
If you do a lot of typing then using this shortcuts will definitely save a lot of time.

For example instead of always reaching out to [Backspace][1] you can always use `Ctrl H`.

#### Works in Terminal
The added benefit is these shortcuts work perfectly well in Terminal no matter what shell you use 

#### Identical behaviour in all editors
Since these shortscut are natively supported they work exactly same in all editors

### Pro Tip:
Many emacs users map Caps lock key  to control key. It becomes very easy to use the above mentioned shortcuts as it is easily accessible to left pinky finger. Also you rarely require Caps lock key, so it can be utilised for somthing that is required frequently. [Here][2] is how you can do it.
